In this paper, the coordinated path following control of multiple underactuated surface vessels with error constraints is studied. By combining tan-type barrier Lyapunov functions, this paper proposes a novel coordinated guidance law composed by desired surge speed and heading angle for each vehicle. By assigning the same number of parameterized paths to vehicles, the coordinated error variable is introduced by the graph theory, and then the desired update law for the each parameter of path is propsed to accomplish the coordination task. To track the desired guidance signal quickly and accuratly with high robustness, the radial neural-nerwork controller is developed for each vehicle by backstepping technique, in which, the neural network is used to estimate the unknown kinetic disturbances instantaneously. All closed-loop traking errors are proved to be uniform ultimately bounded by Lyapunov theory. In addition, the coordinated path following erros are bounded in the prescibed boundaries.
